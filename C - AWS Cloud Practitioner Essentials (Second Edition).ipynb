    "There are three common ways (architectures) to organize and store data on modern enterprise storage devices:\n",
    "* [File Level](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/file-storage). Is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data on a computer hard drive or on network-attached storage (NAS) device. In file storage, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders, and the folders are organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories. To locate a file, all you or your computer system need is the path—from directory to subdirectory to folder to file. It  works well with easily organized amounts of structured data.\n",
    "* [Object Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage). It manages data as objects. Object storage systems allow retention of massive amounts of unstructured data. Object storage is used for purposes such as storing photos on Facebook, songs on Spotify, or files in online collaboration services, such as Dropbox.\n",
    "* [Block Level](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/block-storage). Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based storage environments. Developers favor block storage for computing situations where they require fast, efficient, and reliable data transportation.\n",
    "Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. The SAN places those blocks of data wherever it is most efficient. That means it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured (or partitioned) to work with different operating systems.\n"

Using AWS Auto Scaling, you can setup scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. AWS Auto Scaling provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon Aurora Replicas.(...) AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them.(...)There is no additional charge for AWS Auto Scaling.
